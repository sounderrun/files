This script modifies AMD GPU registry settings to optimize performance by disabling power-saving features and adjusting rendering parameters. It first locates the AMD driver registry path under {4d36e968-e325-11ce-bfc1-08002be10318}, then proceeds to disable various power gating mechanisms, including SAMU, UVD, VCE, and DMA, to prevent potential interruptions caused by power-saving modes. It also disables ULPS (Ultra-Low Power State) to ensure consistent GPU performance without the latency introduced by low-power transitions. Additionally, it tweaks rendering settings such as the 3D refresh rate override, tessellation options, shader cache, and flip queue size to enhance responsiveness. The script further disables specific AMD features like AllowRSOverlay, Skins, Subscription, and Anti-Aliasing options to streamline GPU operations. Lastly, it modifies frame pacing and latency settings, including enabling KMD_DeLag and adjusting StutterMode, aiming for improved stability and lower input lag.
