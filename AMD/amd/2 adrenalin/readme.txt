when i tested the control panel settings, a default setting had the best frames for me at least for a 7700xt. so i would start with default and adjust as you need on a per-system basis

recommended settings to mess around with
-tessellation mode: override
-max tessellation level: off
-texture filtering quality: performance
-surface format optimization: on
-Radeon anti lag: on

these settings can be messed around with to see if they improve performance or not^^^
